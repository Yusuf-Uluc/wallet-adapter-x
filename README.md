# wallet-adapter-x

wallet-adapter-x is a wallet adapter implementation which uses [nanostores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores), a lightweight and simple state management library to provide a simple and easy to use interface for interacting with wallets.

Due to the far reaching support of the nanostores library, wallet-adapter-x can be used with any javascript framework.

This library was only created for a demo project which is using [Astro](astro.build) and is not yet intended for production use due to the lack of testing and documentation.

### ⚠️ **Feel free to use this library in your own projects, but please be aware that it is not yet production ready.**
